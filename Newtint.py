    Newtint: Newton interpolating polynomial 
    yint = Newtint(x, y, xx): Uses an (n - 1)-order Newton
        interpolating polynomial based on n data points (x, y)
        to determine a value of the dependent variable (yint)
        at a given value of the independent variable, xx.
    input:
        x = independent variable 
        y = dependent variable 
        xx = value of independent variable at which interpolation 
             is calculated 
    output:
        yint = interpolated value of dependent variable
